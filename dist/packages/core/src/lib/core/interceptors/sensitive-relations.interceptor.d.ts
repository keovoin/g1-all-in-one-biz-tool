/**
 * Interceptor to protect sensitive entity relations based on user permissions.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - Apply @SensitiveRelations(config) on a controller or route handler.
 *   - Apply @UseInterceptors(SensitiveRelationsInterceptor) on the same controller or handler.
 *   - The config is a nested object mapping relation paths to required permissions.
 *
 * At runtime, the interceptor checks the requested relations (from req.query.relations or req.body.relations).
 * For each relation, it traverses the config tree to find if a permission is required.
 * If a required permission is found and the user does not have it, a 403 Forbidden is thrown.
 *
 * This does NOT modify the query or filter the relations, it only blocks access if not permitted.
